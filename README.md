# thatcherize_face
Included is a short script which thatcherizes a face, using Dlib's face landmark detection (of which i own no rights)!
The thatcher effect is well documented in psychological research, and I was hoping this would allow less-technical researchers to apply this to their own face-stimuli!
Best,
Erik
